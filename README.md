## To Do üìå

This is a list of things we want to do in this project:

- [ ] .

## Description üìù

Within the Southeast district of Amsterdam, the Sports promotion department is responsible for implementing the local sports promotion policy. The department is working on an accessible sports environment for all Amsterdam residents, where everyone can find the offer that suits him / her and can enjoy the sport. The Sports Stimulation department in Southeast has the desire to bring all sports, from events to workshops, to the center of attention through an app.

## Installing üîç

To install this application enter the following into your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/RobinStut/meesterproef.git

cd meesterproef

npm install

node start
```

### Packages and Technologies

This project makes use of the following packages and technologies:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [body-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser)
- [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)
- [EJS](https://ejs.co/)
- [node-fetch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch)
- [multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer)

## Research üïµüèª

The whole project comes down to the following statement:

> There are many sport providers in Southeast (around 180), but the participation of the inhabitants (around 900.000) in sport activities there is the lowest in whole Amsterdam. Providers often have difficulty in spotlighting their offer and potential users may have problems to find what they are looking for.

### The Residents of Southeast

The residents consist of people both young and old who live in Amsterdam Southeast. They consist for 2/3 of people from outside the Netherlands, they don't practice normal sports because they mostly can be found on the local play and sport ground. And there are a lot of single moms.

They want to use the app to find sports that they maybe wouldn't have thought about at first. They need to be inspirited.

### The Sport Providers

The sport providers consist of the local sport clubs. They have a lot to offer but sport participation numbers in Southeast are the lowest in the whole of Amsterdam.

They want to use the app to reach the residents by creating a personal page for their club or organisation where they can post events for example.

### The Sport Brokers

The sport brokers help the residents of Southeast with questions they have about sports. For example a mom asks what possibilities there are for their children to participate in.

They want to have a list of all sports that they can browse through to help people find a fitting sport.

## How It Works üõ†Ô∏è

We have worked on three use cases in the app:

- Sport clubs are able to create activities.
- Residents are able to fill out a quiz that acts as a filter to show them sports together with matching activities that they can try out.
- Sport brokers can use a list and map view to help people find sports for them.
